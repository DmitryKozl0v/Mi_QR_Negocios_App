Mi QR is an app designed to save a person's personal data (under said person permission), and store it on a Firebase Database, and gives the user a QR code, which will be scanned by the second part of this app, Mi QR Negocios.

This was developed to answer a problematic cause by COVID-19, where people would go to any restaurant, retail store, supermarket, etc, and their data would be written down by hand on paper for COVID-19 tracing purposes, making the process tedius, slow and unhealthy.
